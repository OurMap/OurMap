            In order to define your map area, youâ€™ll first need to choose what style of Background Map to use for your project. (Note:  for the moment only one option is available. In the future, there will be others.)

    <p class="Estilo1">NOTE TO USERS: </p>
    <p class="Estilo1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">Your choice of a Background  Map will affect what kind of geographic detail your map shows. Also, some maps  do not cover the whole Earth. So it is important to select a Background Map  that will cover the region you want to map in the appropriate detail. </p>
    <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">We recommend option  1 (Google Maps / Open Layers) as the easiest option for getting started and  choosing your map boundaries, because this option provides up to 10 detailed background  maps to choose from. And these maps cover nearly the whole planet in a fair  amount of detail. So these maps should suit the purposes of most projects, at  least in cases where you don&rsquo;t need a specialized type of map feature detail. </p>
    <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">TIP:&nbsp; You can always use Google Maps to choose your  map boundaries, and then add or upload another Background Map later. You can  also change your map&rsquo;s boundaries later on if you need to refine them. </p>
    <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">Option 2 lets you browse  the OurMap database to find another background map that covers your region. We  have uploaded a number of maps here that may be useful if you are looking for a  map with a more specialized kind of detail for your area. (For example, a  geological map or map with lots of specialized biological information.)</p>
    <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">Finally, choosing  Option 3 will allow you to upload your own map to use as a background. In this  case, you will need to have a map saved on your computer in a compatible file  type (shapefile or kml). Note that if you do upload your own map in this way, it will then  be stored in our map database, and you can choose to make it available to other  users in the future. It will then be available for browsing in Option 2. </p>
    <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify" class="Estilo1">Or, if you have a  scanned or hand-drawn map that is not yet calibrated with GPS coordinates, you  can also upload your map as a simple JPG image and then calibrate it manually to  establish the GPS coordinates. This will require some extra steps, and you will  need to go out and gather some GPS coordinates in your map area, so this option  is recommended only for advanced users. </p>
